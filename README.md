# tw0flower's homelab
This project is an attempt to automate the creation of self-hosted services all the way from basic OS provisioning the basic OS to deploying the end-user applications.

It project was inspired by [Khue's Homelab](https://github.com/khuedoan/homelab) and you should really check his project. 

# Architecture

In addition to a Kubernetes cluster, I use FreeIPA to manage DNS and certificates for local services.
